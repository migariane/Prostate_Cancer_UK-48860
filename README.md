## ABSTRACT 
Evidence regarding the role of metabolic syndrome as the risk factor for prostate cancer is contradictory. We assessed the association between the metabolic syndrome and its individual components (hypertension, high triglyceride, central obesity, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and diabetes) with prostate cancer incidence, using the UK Biobank data. Data were analyzed using a competing risk causal inference framework, specifically g-computation methods. Our main outcome was cause-specific cumulative incidence prostate cancer risk. The analyses were based on the clinically important confounders. Metabolic syndrome was not associated with the prostate cancer incidence (cause-specific rate ratio [csRR] 1.02; 95% CI, 0.89–1.16), however, some of its individual components were associated with prostate cancer. Having diabetes (csRR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63–0.91), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (csRR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.75–1.06), or hyperlipidemia (csRR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.84–1.15) reduced the risk of prostate cancer. In contrast, having hypertension (csRR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.01–1.45) or being obese (csRR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.09–1.55) increased the risk of prostate cancer. Investigating metabolic syndrome as a single disorder is likely to lead to paradoxical findings. Since it is a cluster of biochemical factors and diseases, metabolic syndrome needs to be assessed by analyzing the role of its individual components in the development of prostate cancer or other diseases. The risk of prostate cancer may be reduced by targeting preventive strategies to decrease hypertension and/or obesity prevalence.
