## ABSTRACT 
The relationship between metabolic syndrome and prostate cancer risk remains unclear. This study assessed the association between metabolic syndrome and its individual components (hypertension, high triglycerides, central obesity, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and prediabetes/diabetes) with prostate cancer incidence using data from the UK Biobank. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of prostate cancer, while adjusting for significant clinical confounders. Overall, metabolic syndrome showed no association with prostate cancer incidence (RR 0.94; 95% CI, 0.84–1.06); however, when assessed individually, hypertension (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01–1.41) was associated with increased prostate cancer risk. In contrast, prediabetes/diabetes (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78–1.04), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.89–1.17), obesity (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.98–1.34) and hyperlipidemia (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76–1.00) did not show a significant association. These findings suggest that considering metabolic syndrome as a single disorder may produce misleading results. Given that it comprises a combination of biochemical markers and conditions, assessing each component’s relation to prostate cancer risk is essential. Intervention focusing on hypertension might hold potential in reducing prostate cancer risk.
